            During the game, the player has 3 lives. Using the left and right arrow keys,
            you must dodge incoming projectiles aimed towards them. Additionally,
            you must watch out for vicious meteor attacks (<img src="images/drop/meteorRed.png" alt="meteor" width="34" height="27" style="vertical-align: middle">).
            Failing to avoid these hazards results in the player losing a life.
            The game ends when the player loses all lives or eliminates all enemies.
            Moreover, there are opportunities to collect falling bonus items, known as drops,
            which can assist in various ways (<img src="images/drop/gift1.png" alt="gift1"  width="32" height="32" style="vertical-align: middle">).
            With gift1, you gain +1 life (<img src="images/drop/gift2.png" alt="gift2"  width="32" height="32" style="vertical-align: middle">).
            Acquiring gift2 grants +200 points.

        <h2>How to Earn Rubies? <img src="images/ikon/rubyPic.png" alt="ruby" width="30" height="30"></h2>
        <p>
            Rubies are the in-game currency that you can use to unlock new spaceships and battlefields in the customization menu. Earning rubies is essential to enhance your gaming experience and explore all the unique options available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rubies are primarily earned by completing levels in the game. There are five levels in total, and each level rewards you with progressively more rubies as you advance. Each level has a specific difficulty ranking:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1 (Easy):</strong> Complete this level to earn 50 rubies.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2 (Normal):</strong> Earn 75 rubies by completing this level.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3 (Normal):</strong> Finish this level to receive 100 rubies.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 4 (Hard):</strong> Conquer this level to gain 125 rubies.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 5 (Brutal):</strong> Defeat the final boss in this level to earn 150 rubies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As you advance through the levels, the difficulty increases, making the game more challenging and rewarding. The final level, Level 5, features a secret boss fight where your skills will be truly tested. Successfully defeating the boss will earn you the highest ruby reward of 150 rubies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The difficulty progression is as follows: Easy, Normal, Normal, Hard, and Brutal. Keep playing, master the challenges, and accumulate rubies to unlock all the customization options available!
